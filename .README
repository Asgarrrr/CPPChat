# CPPChat, a C++ chat server and client

CPPChat is a simple chat server and client written in C++, using the Qt framework.
It is a simple example of how to use Qt's networking classes to create a simple
chat server and client.

Also, we have a web client, written in JavaScript, that uses websockets to connect to the server.

## Building

### Requirements

* Qt 5.2 or later
* CMake 2.8.11 or later

### Building the server

To build the server, run the following commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

### Building the client

Same as the server, but run the following commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DBUILD_CLIENT=ON ..
    make

### Building the web client
    Double click on the `webclient/index.html` file. x)

## What's next?

This is a very simple example of a chat server and client. There are many things that could be added to it, such as:

* A GUI for the server
* Asymmetric encryption
* A better protocol
* A better authentication system (maybe using SSL)
* A better way to handle the client list
* Add cool features, like private messages, markdown on messages, command system ( like Discord ), etc.
